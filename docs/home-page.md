# HomePage Notes & Checklist
## Ideas
- Keep it clean and simple.
- Show name clearly at top.
- Quick summary of who I am and what I do.
- Add 1-2 call-to-action buttons (Projects / Contact).
- Soft background (gradient or light color).
- Text should feel welcoming and professional.
- Responsive design â€” should look good on mobile and desktop.
- Light animations to make it feel more alive (optional later).

## Basic Layout
- Full-screen section (min height = screen height).
- Centered text vertically and horizontally.
- Max width container to prevent text from stretching.

## Content
- Name (Big heading).
- Title or tagline (smaller heading).
- Short paragraph about me.
- Buttons: "View Projects", "Contact Me".

## Styling
- Background: Light gradient or very light gray.
- Big bold fonts for headings.
- Softer color for paragraph text.
- Button hover effects (color change or slight grow).

## Later Improvements
- Add entrance animations (fade-in, slide).
- Possibly add a background image or SVG.
- Improve SEO (page title, meta description).
- Accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, color contrast).
